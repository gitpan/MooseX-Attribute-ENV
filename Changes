Revision history for Perl extension MooseX-Attribute-ENV.

0.02    11 January 2011
        - fixed a bug caused by the fact my generated default code was returning
          an explicit undef, and not nothing.  This caused errors when the
          attribute was optional but had a type constraint.
        - Removed some unneeded whitespace from code

0.01    07 June 2008
        - Setup repository, created application skeleton
        - Created tests, released.
