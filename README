MooseX-Attribute-ENV

This is a L<Moose> attribute trait that you use when you want the default value
for an attribute to be populated from the %ENV hash.  So, for example if you
have set the environment variable MYAPP_MYCLASS_USERNAME = 'John' you can do:

	package MyApp::MyClass;
	
	use Moose;
	use MooseX::Attribute::ENV;
	
	has 'username' => (is=>'ro', traits=>['ENV']);
	
	package main;
	
	my $myclass = MyApp::MyClass->new();
	
	print $myclass->username; # STDOUT => 'John';

This is basically similar functionality to something like:

	has 'attr' => (
		is=>'ro',
		default=> sub {
			$ENV{uc __PACKAGE_.'attr'};
		},
	);
	
but this module has a few other features that offer merit, as well as being a
simple enough attribute trait that I hope it can serve as a learning tool.
